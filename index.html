    This is the central location for all documentation related to creating display advertising banner units using the
    <a href="https://mediamonks.github.io/display-advertising-docs/generator/">Richmedia Generator</a> and

</p>

<p>
    Richmedia Generator, Temple Server... a lot of new terms here and if you are feeling a little overwhelmed that is
    alright, but we promise it really is not that scary and all the information that you need to get up and running in
    creating your very own display advertising banners and editing richmeida units can be found within the pages of
    this documentation.
</p>

<h2>What is the Generator?</h2>

<p>
    Just like the name suggests this tool is what you will use to generate your richmedia units. Simply put the
    generator is a scaffolding tool built to help you easily create richmedia units. This richmedia generator was built
    with the use of Yeoman. Yeoman is web scaffolding tool for modern webtools. If you would like to know more
    about Yoeman you can head over to their site <a href="https://yeoman.io/">here</a> .
</p>

<h2>Richmedia Temple Server</h2>

<p>
    So now that you know what the generator is, let's explain what the Temple Server is. The Temple server is the second
    tool that you will use in your display advertising tool box. The richmedia temple server (RTS) is a build and
    development server, that allows you to develop, build and preview richmedia units as fast as possible. This site was
    created to be a step-by-step guide for getting started using the temple server, as well as developing, building and
    previewing you advertising display banners.
